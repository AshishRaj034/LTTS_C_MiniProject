# Requirements

## Introduction
* Knowing the units of measurement that correspond with a number can give you so much more information than a digit as a standalone. 

* In a nutshell, the unit of measurement in science and math serves as the supporting pillar upon which a number rests.

* **Unit conversion** is a process that involves multiplication or division by a numerical factor.

* With the global flow of information that occurs these days, it is very important for everyone to learn these most basic conversion factors.

* Keeping in mind all the conversion and inter-conversion processes may not be easy for everyone.

* A metric conversion calculator is a tool that renders a helping hand by doing metric conversions in few seconds.

## Research
* During the French Revolution, the then existing measurement system was so impractical for trade and scientific purposes. 

* So, it set the stage for the emergence of a system of measurement with rationally related units and simple rules for combining them.

* Thus, a decimal based conversion system, called the Metric System,  was introduced and it was widely accepted by scientists of those days for being a rational system.

* The metric system was devised with a aim “for all people, for all time.”

* Today, the official system of measurement in most of the countries across the world is the metric system also known as the “International System of Units.

* Though a standard system, there are many units within the metric systems and inter-conversion is tedious because one has to remember all the conversion factors.

* Hence a tool that makes all these conversion immediately available will be a welcoming choice.

## Cost and Features
Since the system uses only open source software, it is free of cost..!!

*TBD*

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

The tool is a helping hand for young children who would like to counter verify their conversions and also for scientific researchers and mathematicians.

## What:

A metric conversion calculator that does metric conversions in few seconds.

## When:

When people are struggling with simple conversions or when kids would like to cross verify their answers while practicing or when people need conversion results in a jiffy to proceed on further with their calculations. 

## Where:

Can be put to use where simple or advanced scientific and mathematic calculations requiring conversions are involved.

## How:

The system opens up to the standard list of metric conversions that are available. Upon selection of one the standard system, the list of inter-conversions i.e., the sub-system is shown on the screen. The user can now choose one sub unit that needs to be converted into one or more other sub units that is available on the list.  The results for all these conversions are flashed in a second.
